"Skill Points are not granted when leveling while entering and exiting a mech. Use the Skill Tab Reset Button to gain any missing points.
When two or more Specialization Lore toasts should pop, only one does (all are still unlocked, however).
Elementress and Hunter do not have robust Tech descriptions.
Jewelry does not slot into some modded armor due to how certain mods categorize armor.
Certain Ranged Weapons added by other mods do not utilize 'bullet' or 'shotgun' damage kinds, meaning they do not progress the Specialization unlocks that require Ranged Weapon kills.
Stardust Lib overwrites npc_primary.lua, causing shielded NPCs to be unkillable.
Katanas do not trigger Perfect Shield bonuses."

"Mechanics:
    Fixed a bug where the Level Up text pop-up would show numbers greater than 50 when grabbing large chunks of experience.
Profession:
    Jeweler:
        Fixed two longstanding bugs, one that could corrupt armor, and the other that would duplicate effects.
        Jewelry should now be equippable on most armor pieces.
        Added a radio message when picking up jewelry as well as a lore entry for better instructions.
Classes:
    Soldier: fixed a bug with Tank Sphere that would cause energy to lock.
Specializations:
    Remaining Specializations can now be equipped (Assassin, Warlock, Saboteur, Pilot, Scout, Thief, Mercenary, Berserker, and Trapper).
        ^red;Note, these Specializations are not fully complete!^reset;
    Adept:
        Flash Step activation modified: hold Shift to teleport. Jumping without holding Shift changed back to a normal jump.
        Revamped Phase Shift: While holding Primary Fire, cursor movement is tracked. Upon releasing Primary Fire, unleash a rift of energy that follows those movements, dealing more damage the longer it travels. Releasing Primary Fire directly on top of an enemy will create distortions, pulling in and freezing nearby enemies in time.*
        Revamped Passive: Nearby allies gain a temporary Speed Boost once Energy recharges. When Energy depletes, nearby enemies are pushed away and frozen in time.*
    Battle Mage:
        Now has Strength Scaling x2 instead of x1.
        Can now be unlocked with scythes.
        Revamped Tech: Battle Aura improved in various ways, with better damage, defense, and speed potential than prior.*
        Gave Solstice a passive: while charge, kills with Solstice prevent Battle Auras from decaying for a few seconds.*
    Changeling:
        Grants +15 Virtual Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence.
        While transformed, gain an additional +20% Physical Resistance and +15 Virtual Agility and Endurance.
        Wisper:
            Acceleration increased by 300% for tighter turns and so that maximum movement speed is reached faster.
            Primary Fire windup decreased to 0.5 from 0.8 seconds. Ice projectile speed doubled and hitbox increased. Deals 100% more damage.
            Alt Fire windup decreased to 0.5 from 0.8 seconds. Consumes 5% Max Health on cast, rather than 10%, but deals the same amount of damage.
        Poptop:
            Walk Speed increased to 3 from 2. Run Speed increased to 8 from 3.
            Primary Fire windup decreased to 0.2 from 0.4 seconds. Restores 15% of Damage Dealt as Health.* Deals 100% more damage.
            Alt Fire length increased to 0.9 from 0.7 seconds. If no enemy is found within 0.45 seconds, Alt Fire immediately ends, allowing you to move again; otherwise, the move acts as normal, but lasts 0.2 seconds longer.
            Special 2 no longer consumes Energy. Now immediately increases Movement Speed by 20%, increases up to 50%, and does not decay like Power Multiplier.
            Removed the Decreased Agility Scaling.
        Adult Poptop:
            Walk Speed increased to 3 from 2. Run Speed increased to 6 from 3.
            Primary Fire windup decreased to 0.3 from 0.5 seconds.
            Alt Fire length increased to 0.9 from 0.7 seconds. If no enemy is found within 0.45 seconds, Alt Fire immediately ends, allowing you to move again; otherwise, the move acts as normal, but lasts 0.2 seconds longer.
        Orbide:
            Walk Speed increased to 2 from 1. Run Speed (not Special 3 Sprint Speed) increased to 6 from 3.
            Primary Fire windup decreased to 0.6 from 1 seconds. Deals 100% more damage.
            Alt Fire restores 10% of Damage Dealt as Health.* Deals 100% more damage.
            When Special 2 is fully activated, monsters lose aggro. Health Regeneration changed to Regeneration 3 from Regeneration 2. 
    Elementress:
        Attune Tech:*
            [Shift] + [Special 2] Attack removed.
            Getting kills with the Primary/Alt Fire Attack increases Elementress' Potential with the Element used: upgrading from Basic, to Decent, to Great, to Chaos. With each upgrade, Primary Fire deals more Damage. At Great, Attune Attacks cover a wider area. At Chaos, Attune Attacks gain additional effects.
            When an Element's Potential is Decent or better, press [Shift] + [Primary Fire] to sacrifice Potential, instantly casting what used to be that Element's [Shift] + [Special 2] Attack.
    Mechanist:
        Skynet Turret and Drone Max Level increased to 6 from 4, and their Level scales 66% faster.
        Increased Turret's Projectile Base Power to 12 from 10.
        Increased Drone's Power Multiplier by 33%, but decreased Turret's Power Multiplier by 33%: Turret's Damage output is now 2.4x that of Drone's, instead of 4x.
        Because Level determines a monster's stats, both Turret and Drone can greatly exceed their damage output pre-patch.
    Necromancer:
        Passive now activates on kill with any weapon, not just Demonic, Scythe, and Dagger damage.
        For Us All now adds an additional 33.3% chance to trigger Necromancer's Passive on kill.*
        Each Bone Pteropod summoned by Reap takes 10% of any damage you take, healing you back by that amount.
        Fixed a bug where 6 Souls only created 5 Bone Pteropods.
    Technomancer:
        To promote the use of the Technomancer Specialization under the Soldier Class, the additional Ranged Weapon Damage Scaling has been changed from Intelligence to Vigor.

    All Techs now specify to jump, rather than to use [Space].
    All Techs now specify directions instead of using [W], [A], [S], or [D].

            Drill activation sound replaced.
Specializations:
    All Specializations are now unlockable, but some are still disabled.
    Certain Specialization unlocks that required stats, such as Kunoichi and Adept, have been laxed by one.
    Adept:
        Can now be unlocked when Mastery is unlocked.
        Now has a specialRequirements parameter in ivrpgSpecList.config so that modders can patch in other values for required Agility and Intelligence (including 0).

        UI for Reap now specifies that Bone Pteropods can only be spawned after getting kills with Reap itself.

        Flash Jump and Wall Cling:
            Not holding a direction now defaults to an upwards jump instead of one in your facing direction. This should make it easier to land on thin platforms, even at high Agility.
                This will also make it harder to accidentally cling to walls when jumping up narrow shafts.

            Because of this, the difference between Ice and Fire has shrunken considerably.
        Controlled Hover:
            Now utilizes WASD rather than aim position.
            Base Energy Cost decreased to 50eps from 75eps.
            Energy Cost greatly decreased when hovering in place or downwards.
