"Currently, to complete Boss Challenges (for Mastery), you must get the final blow on the boss.
Skill Points are not granted when leveling in a mech. Use the Skill Tab Reset Button to gain any missing points.
When two or more Specialization Lore toasts should pop, only one does (all are still unlocked, however).
Elementress and Hunter do not have robust Tech descriptions.
Jewelry does not slot into FU armor due to how FU categorizes its armor.
Certain Ranged Weapons added by other mods do not utilize 'bullet' or 'shotgun' damage kinds, meaning they do not progress the Specialization unlocks that require Ranged Weapon kills."

"UI:
    Removed 'Equip True Understanding' line in Specialization tab if gender matches.
    Overhauled Changelog and Credits Tabs to follow the same list structure as Lore for easier readability and better sorting.
Mechanics:
    Modified unique monsters to use a copy of vanilla scripts to prevent incompatibility with Stardust Lib.
    RPG AI:
        Enemy and friendly AI no longer attempt to dodge environmental projectiles, like rain.
Specializations:
    Necromancer:
        Reap tech now shows how many Bone Pteropods can be spawned via dark floating orbs.
        UI for Reap now specifies that Bone Pteropods can only be spawned after getting kills with Reap itself.
    Deadshot:
        Changed Lotus' bullet pathfinding to better follow mouse cursor.
        Bullets now travel for a short period before being able to start pathfinding.
    Juggernaut:
        Changed Cleaving Meteor primary fire to utilize its own script, rather than the vanilla hammer script, to fix potential issue with another mod.
        Changed Cleaving Meteor primary weapon script so that it cannot be equipped by other Specialization without power loss in Classic Mode.
    Mechanist - A Soldier Specialization - enabled.
    ^green;Thanks to my Patrons^reset;, the following Specializations have been added:
        Sage - A Wizard and Explorer Specialization - enabled.

Classes:
    Soldier:
        MRE now compatible with many mod grenades.
Specializations:
    Necromancer:
        Changed primary fire to utilize its own script, rather than the vanilla broadsword combo script, to fix potential issue with another mod.
    Vigilante:
        Added some more NPC types to unlock list.
    Thanks to my Patrons, the following Specializations have been added:
        Battle Mage - A Wizard Specialization - enabled.
        Shade - A Male Only Ninja Specialization - enabled.
        Juggernaut - A Knight Specialization - enabled.
        Deadshot - A Soldier Specialization - enabled.

    Dark Templar: Abounding Darkness now heals for Bleed Damage / 3 rather than Bleed Damage / 2.

"Items/Weapons:
    All Specialization Weapon Recipes normalized. They now all require Solarium, but their Class Item cost is reduced.
Mechanics:
    Classic Mode:
        Weapon combinations enabled by Specializations are calculated after ones enabled by Professions to prevent cases where combinations that are valid are mistakenly overwritten, and thus disabled, by Professions.
Classes:
    Wizard:
        Nova Staff no longer resets to the wrong Element when holding shift after a certain set of circumstances.
        Translocate:
            During missions, now calculates via pathfinding rather than line of sight. This prevents going through gaps meant for Spike Sphere, but lets you teleport through curved geometry. Thanks Dan.
        Magic Shield:
            Energy Regen Bonus now maxes at a 1.4x Energy Regen Bonus instead of 1.5x.
            Intelligence and Vigor Scaling now takes a bit longer to reach max Energy Regen.
            Now stays active through Instance changes.
        Controlled Hover:
            Energy Multiplier for hovering in place slightly increased (0.5 -> 0.66).
    Ninja:
        Shadow Step:
            During missions, now calculates via pathfinding rather than line of sight. This prevents going through gaps meant for Spike Sphere, but lets you teleport through curved geometry. Thanks Dan.
Specializations:
    Elementress: Eclipse Energy Cost raised from 10 to 25.
    Technomancer - A Soldier and Wizard Specialization - added.
    Dark Templar - A Knight and Ninja Specialization - enabled."

"Classes:
    Class Quests should now be properly finishable when using SAILs from FU or Racial Mods.
    Ninja:
        Shadow Step:
            No longer generates Item Configs without a protected call, and the damage calculation for the slash attack was altered, meaning Lua crashes when using this tech should never occur.
        Flash Jump and Wall Cling:
            Not holding a direction now defaults to an upwards jump instead of one in your facing direction. This should make it easier to land on thin platforms, even at high Agility.
                This will also make it harder to accidentally cling to walls when jumping up narrow shafts.
            Landing in water after using a flash jump now takes a brief period of time before removing Feather Fall to prevent taking damage.
Professions:
    Smith:
        Smith Station no longer allows you to change the element of Legendary and Essential Weapons.
            This should prevent errors with these weapons.
        Smith Station Weapon Levels lowered. Copper can no longer be used, Iron is Level 1, and Solarium is Level 6.
        Smith UI increased in size so that more information can be added.
Mechanics:
    RPG Growth now loads after Difficulty+ to prevent protection from granting 100% Damage Reduction.
    Killing enemies with Bleed counts as whatever damage kind was used to proc bleed when unlocking Specializations.
RPG AI:
    Because of variable/function name refactoring, RPG AI must now have the same refactor-version as RPG Growth to work.
    Some monsters behaviors were changed.
Bug Fixes:
    Certain Functions and Variables refactored to prevent compatibility issues."

"Items:
    Recipes for Class Items and Weapons reduced drastically and normalized.
    Recipes for Class Items using Mastery Points normalized.
    Tungsten Wands:
        As part of RPG Growth's soon-to-come intrinsic Magic Overhaul, three new Tier 2 Wands have been added to the Anvil.
        These three wands come in Ice, Fire, and Electric elements, and are greatly helpful to early-game Wizards.
    Broken Wand:
        Now properly discharges when Energy locks.
Enemies:
    New Monsters added, with various mechanics to increase combat difficulty.
    Check Lore - Mechanics - Enemies for more information after you defeat one.
UI:
    Rudimentary Level Up Bar now toggleable via the Overview Tab (little Check Mark at the bottom).
    Class Weapon Quest can now be restarted infinitely in case it was abandoned.
Professions:
    Tamer:
        Toggleable Ability now only activates on captured monsters, as stated.
        This also makes the range at which it works infinite, and lowers script strain.
Classes:
    Initial Class Weapon Quest can now be abandoned.
    Ninja:
        Aether Tantos can now be partially aimed three times mid-combo.
        Vanish Sphere no longer bounces backwards when transforming with high Agility.
    Wizard:
        Nova:
            Damage change from element difference no longer grows multiplicatively at higher Power Multipliers.
            Because of this, the difference between Ice and Fire has shrunken considerably.
        Controlled Hover:
            Now utilizes WASD rather than aim position.
            Base Energy Cost decreased to 50eps from 75eps.
            Energy Cost greatly decreased when hovering in place or downwards.
            Energy Cost greatly increased when hovering upwards.
            Speed is now normalized in every direction.
        Gravity Sphere:
            Hover Sphere Upgrade Chip now follows the same logic as Controlled Hover.
    Soldier:
        No longer need to equip a Grenade with One-Handed Ranged Weapons to receive 120% Base Damage. Bonus now applies when at least one - but not more than one - One-Handed Ranged Weapon is equipped.
Skills:
    True Understanding - Body: now provides +5 Max Health.
    True Understanding - Mind: now provides +5 Max Energy.
    True Understanding - Soul: now provides +2.5% Power Multiplier.
Mechanics:
    Initial Weapon Quests changed from gathering items to battling in an Arena.
    Added compatibility with Equivalent Exchange - specifically for the 6 Class Item drops.
Techs:
    All basic Class Techs now have a built in shortcut to open the Mysterious Book - Hold Shift and triple-tap Crouch within ~0.45 seconds.
Specializations:
    Hunter's Cloak, when active, de-activates after dealing damage.
    Valkyrie's Specialization Lore now properly unlocks when Valkyrie is unlocked.
    Unlocking Captain now utilizes a script from the new Companion Lua to reduce script load.
    Dark Templar is still disabled while its Weapon is being created, and its Tech reworked."
