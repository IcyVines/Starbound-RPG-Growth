"Skill Points are not granted when leveling while entering and exiting a mech. Use the Skill Tab Reset Button to gain any missing points.
When two or more Specialization Lore toasts should pop, only one does (all are still unlocked, however).
Elementress and Hunter do not have robust Tech descriptions.
Jewelry does not slot into some modded armor due to how certain mods categorize armor.
Certain Ranged Weapons added by other mods do not utilize 'bullet' or 'shotgun' damage kinds, meaning they do not progress the Specialization unlocks that require Ranged Weapon kills.
Stardust Core overwrites npc_primary.lua, causing shielded NPCs to be unkillable.
Katanas do not trigger Perfect Shield bonuses."

"Announcement:
Rylasasin (who had previously contributed) has been added as a dev and will be maintaining this mod in the future, as the original author no longer has the time nor energy to do so.
For those familar with the 'Rylasasin Fork', those changes have been merged (with a notable exception.) For those not familiar, they will be listed below.
For the forseeable future, efforts will be spent on improving what is already here instead of adding new major things (like Specs.) We apologize to those that were looking forward to the Pilot/Theif/Etc specs,
but that simply will not happen in the forseeable future.

Finally, we must announce removal of GiC support. They wish for a Standalone experience, and we will respect that. Plus it will allow us to concentrate efforts on compatibility with other mods (Arcana, Maple32, Starforge, etc.)
We appreciate your understanding.
Mechanics:
    Mechanist can now be unlocked (faster) by killing Frackin, Shellguard, FFS/DaE, Arcana, and Maple32 robots. Defeating robot bosses from these mods vastly helps.
	Mechanist Fortify covers these too.
	Valkyrie can now use shortspears.
	Most Specializations no longer have stat requirements. They looked good on paper before skills were a thing, but no one likes them now so they're gone.
	Specializations are unlockable at level 25 instead of 35.
	Affinities can be upgraded at level 35 instead of 45.
Compatiblity:
	Swansong now drops XP
	Return to Earth bosses and monsters drop XP
	Arcana support
	Maple32 support
	Kitsunebn and Lucario Aura usable with all classes in classic (all races for now but will change in the future).
Chips:
	Four new weapon chips, two for Omniathrower and two for the Orbital.
		Omniapressure increases Omniathrower range and knockback at the expense of effect duration.
		Omniapalm leaves sticky projectiles on surfaces and has increased after effects at the expense of direct damage.
		Nebula causes orbitals to phase through walls at the cost of range.
		High Orbit increases range and gives seeking to orbitals, at the expense of projectiles no longer bouncing/peircing.

        Jewelry should now be equippable on most armor pieces.
        Added a radio message when picking up jewelry as well as a lore entry for better instructions.

    Wizard's Class Ability modified to work with Wands, Staffs, Grimoires, and Magic Orbs.
Specializations:
    Adept:
        Flash Step activation modified: hold Shift to teleport. Jumping without holding Shift changed back to a normal jump.
    Battle Mage:
        Now has Strength Scaling x2 instead of x1.
        Can now be unlocked with scythes.
        Revamped Tech: Battle Aura improved in various ways, with better damage, defense, and speed potential than prior.
        Gave Solstice a passive: while charged, kills with Solstice prevent Battle Auras from decaying for a few seconds.
    Changeling:
        Grants +15 Virtual Strength, Dexterity, and Intelligence.
        While transformed, gain an additional +20% Physical Resistance and +15 Virtual Agility and Endurance.
        Wisper:
            Base Flight Speed increased from 8 to 10.
            Acceleration increased by 300% for tighter turns and so that maximum movement speed is reached faster.
            Primary Fire windup decreased to 0.5 from 0.8 seconds. Ice projectile speed doubled and hitbox increased. Deals 100% more damage.
            Alt Fire windup decreased to 0.5 from 0.8 seconds. Consumes 5% Max Health on cast, rather than 10%, but deals the same amount of damage.
        Poptop:
            Walk Speed increased to 3 from 2. Run Speed increased to 8 from 3.
            Primary Fire windup decreased to 0.2 from 0.4 seconds. Restores 15% of Damage Dealt as Health. Deals 100% more damage.
            Alt Fire length increased to 0.9 from 0.7 seconds. If no enemy is found within 0.45 seconds, Alt Fire immediately ends, allowing you to move again; otherwise, the move acts as normal, but lasts 0.2 seconds longer.
            Special 2 no longer consumes Energy. Now immediately increases Movement Speed by 20%, increases up to 50%, and does not decay like Power Multiplier.
            Removed the Decreased Agility Scaling.
        Adult Poptop:
            Walk Speed increased to 3 from 2. Run Speed increased to 6 from 3.
            Primary Fire windup decreased to 0.3 from 0.5 seconds.
            Alt Fire length increased to 0.9 from 0.7 seconds. If no enemy is found within 0.45 seconds, Alt Fire immediately ends, allowing you to move again; otherwise, the move acts as normal, but lasts 0.2 seconds longer.
        Orbide:
            Walk Speed increased to 2 from 1. Run Speed (not Special 3 Sprint Speed) increased to 6 from 3.
            Primary Fire windup decreased to 0.6 from 1 seconds. Deals 100% more damage.
            Alt Fire restores 10% of Damage Dealt as Health. Deals 100% more damage.
            When Special 2 is fully activated, monsters lose aggro. Health Regeneration changed to Regeneration 3 from Regeneration 2.
    Mechanist:
        Skynet Turret and Drone Max Level increased to 6 from 4, and their Level scales 66% faster.
        Increased Turret's Projectile Base Power to 12 from 10.
        Increased Drone's Power Multiplier by 33%, but decreased Turret's Power Multiplier by 33%: Turret's Damage output is now 2.4x that of Drone's, instead of 4x.
        Because Level determines a monster's stats, both Turret and Drone can greatly exceed their damage output pre-patch.
    Necromancer:
        Passive now activates on kill with any weapon, not just Demonic, Scythe, and Dagger damage.
        For Us All now adds an additional, individual 50% chance to trigger Necromancer's Passive on kill.
        Each Bone Pteropod summoned by Reap takes 10% of any damage you take, healing you back by that amount.
        Fixed a bug where 6 Souls only created 5 Bone Pteropods.
    Technomancer:
        To promote the use of the Technomancer Specialization under the Soldier Class, the additional Ranged Weapon Damage Scaling has been changed from Intelligence to Vigor.

    Dark Templar: Abounding Darkness now heals for Bleed Damage / 3 rather than Bleed Damage / 2.
    Hunter: Cloaking now utilizes a unique Camouflage Status."

                "version" : 1.62,
                "children" :
"Items/Weapons:
    All Specialization Weapon Recipes normalized. They now all require Solarium, but their Class Item cost is reduced.
Mechanics:
    Classic Mode:
        Weapon combinations enabled by Specializations are calculated after ones enabled by Professions to prevent cases where combinations that are valid are mistakenly overwritten, and thus disabled, by Professions.
Classes:
    Wizard:
        Nova Staff no longer resets to the wrong Element when holding shift after a certain set of circumstances.
        Translocate:
            During missions, now calculates via pathfinding rather than line of sight. This prevents going through gaps meant for Spike Sphere, but lets you teleport through curved geometry. Thanks Dan.
        Magic Shield:
            Energy Regen Bonus now maxes at a 1.4x Energy Regen Bonus instead of 1.5x.
            Intelligence and Vigor Scaling now takes a bit longer to reach max Energy Regen.
            Now stays active through Instance changes.
        Controlled Hover:
            Energy Multiplier for hovering in place slightly increased (0.5 -> 0.66).
    Ninja:
        Shadow Step:
            During missions, now calculates via pathfinding rather than line of sight. This prevents going through gaps meant for Spike Sphere, but lets you teleport through curved geometry. Thanks Dan.
Specializations:
    Elementress: Eclipse Energy Cost raised from 10 to 25.
    Technomancer - A Soldier and Wizard Specialization - added.
    Dark Templar - A Knight and Ninja Specialization - enabled."

            "1.61" : {
                "title" : "Patch 1.61",
                "version" : 1.61,
                "children" :
"Classes:
    Class Quests should now be properly finishable when using SAILs from FU or Racial Mods.
    Ninja:
        Shadow Step:
            No longer generates Item Configs without a protected call, and the damage calculation for the slash attack was altered, meaning Lua crashes when using this tech should never occur.
        Flash Jump and Wall Cling:
            Not holding a direction now defaults to an upwards jump instead of one in your facing direction. This should make it easier to land on thin platforms, even at high Agility.
                This will also make it harder to accidentally cling to walls when jumping up narrow shafts.
            Landing in water after using a flash jump now takes a brief period of time before removing Feather Fall to prevent taking damage.
Professions:
    Smith:
        Smith Station no longer allows you to change the element of Legendary and Essential Weapons.
            This should prevent errors with these weapons.
        Smith Station Weapon Levels lowered. Copper can no longer be used, Iron is Level 1, and Solarium is Level 6.
        Smith UI increased in size so that more information can be added.
Mechanics:
    RPG Growth now loads after Difficulty+ to prevent protection from granting 100% Damage Reduction.
    Killing enemies with Bleed counts as whatever damage kind was used to proc bleed when unlocking Specializations.
RPG AI:
    Because of variable/function name refactoring, RPG AI must now have the same refactor-version as RPG Growth to work.
    Some monsters behaviors were changed.
Bug Fixes:
    Certain Functions and Variables refactored to prevent compatibility issues."

                "children" :
"Items:
    Recipes for Class Items and Weapons reduced drastically and normalized.
    Recipes for Class Items using Mastery Points normalized.
    Tungsten Wands:
        As part of RPG Growth's soon-to-come intrinsic Magic Overhaul, three new Tier 2 Wands have been added to the Anvil.
        These three wands come in Ice, Fire, and Electric elements, and are greatly helpful to early-game Wizards.
    Broken Wand:
        Now properly discharges when Energy locks.
Enemies:
    New Monsters added, with various mechanics to increase combat difficulty.
    Check Lore - Mechanics - Enemies for more information after you defeat one.
UI:
    Rudimentary Level Up Bar now toggleable via the Overview Tab (little Check Mark at the bottom).
    Class Weapon Quest can now be restarted infinitely in case it was abandoned.
Professions:
    Tamer:
        Toggleable Ability now only activates on captured monsters, as stated.
        This also makes the range at which it works infinite, and lowers script strain.
Classes:
    Initial Class Weapon Quest can now be abandoned.
    Ninja:
        Aether Tantos can now be partially aimed three times mid-combo.
        Vanish Sphere no longer bounces backwards when transforming with high Agility.
    Wizard:
        Nova:
            Damage change from element difference no longer grows multiplicatively at higher Power Multipliers.
            Because of this, the difference between Ice and Fire has shrunken considerably.
        Controlled Hover:
            Now utilizes WASD rather than aim position.
            Base Energy Cost decreased to 50eps from 75eps.
            Energy Cost greatly decreased when hovering in place or downwards.
            Energy Cost greatly increased when hovering upwards.
            Speed is now normalized in every direction.
        Gravity Sphere:
            Hover Sphere Upgrade Chip now follows the same logic as Controlled Hover.
    Soldier:
        No longer need to equip a Grenade with One-Handed Ranged Weapons to receive 120% Base Damage. Bonus now applies when at least one - but not more than one - One-Handed Ranged Weapon is equipped.
Skills:
    True Understanding - Body: now provides +5 Max Health.
    True Understanding - Mind: now provides +5 Max Energy.
    True Understanding - Soul: now provides +2.5% Power Multiplier.
Mechanics:
    Initial Weapon Quests changed from gathering items to battling in an Arena.
    Added compatibility with Equivalent Exchange - specifically for the 6 Class Item drops.
Techs:
    All basic Class Techs now have a built in shortcut to open the Mysterious Book - Hold Shift and triple-tap Crouch within ~0.45 seconds.
Specializations:
    Hunter's Cloak, when active, de-activates after dealing damage.
    Valkyrie's Specialization Lore now properly unlocks when Valkyrie is unlocked.
    Unlocking Captain now utilizes a script from the new Companion Lua to reduce script load.
    Dark Templar is still disabled while its Weapon is being created, and its Tech reworked."
