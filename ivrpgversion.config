    Skills:
        Reset Button added to Skill Tab. Instantly refunds all Skill Points and unequips all Skills.
        If you are missing Skill Points bcause of leveling while in a Mech, use this to get back the appropriate amount.
        Skills may be changed for balance reasons in the future, as the current selection of Skills is like a beta of the Skill System.
Items:
    Caine's Chest:
        Thanks to my Patron, Caine, for requesting and helping design this awesome weapon.
        Caine's Chest is craftable via the Chest tab in the Industrial Workbench.
        It will function like a normal Chest, but leave it in the dark and you'll be met with a surprise. Be careful...
UI:
    Fixed some spelling errors.
Specializations:
    Hunter:
        A Rogue Specialization.
        Now unlockable, but can not be equipped yet.
Bug Fixes:
    Refactored a variable in a shared script to try and prevent errors with mods such as Frackin' Universe and Races.
