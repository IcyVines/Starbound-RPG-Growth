  "description" : "[h1]Welcome to a brand new way to play Starbound![/h1]\n\nThis mod adds the ability to raise stats to make your character stronger. Simply go out there and fight monsters, and once some xp drops, you'll learn how to craft the Mysterious Book, which enables you to do a whole bunch of cool things.\n\nWith each level you gain through collecting XP, you'll be able to allocate stat points and unlock new techs. In order to start adding stats, pick from 6 classes: Knight, Wizard, Ninja, Soldier, Rogue, and Explorer. Each one has their own style of play and special abilities and techs.\n\nIf you would like to see more information about classes, stats, experience, leveling, techs, compatibility, effects, or crafting, please visit this google docs page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t6rcD43adAM1sUD4cOROOJJXa24PZYnYy0-5a12O3Us/edit?usp=sharing\n\n[b]In order to start allocating stats, you must craft the Mysterious Book using 1 XP from your personal crafting menu, OR download QuickBar Mini: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1088459034 [/b]\n\n[h1]Discord and Patreon[/h1]\nIf you would like to join our Discord server to discuss the mod or have fun, please do!\nLink: https://discord.gg/YUDq6pw\n\nIf you would like to donate to my Patreon, visit here: https://www.patreon.com/IcyVines\nDonating grants access to the Veteran role on the Discord server, and higher tiers enable you to request a personal weapon, but the fact that you enjoy my mod enough to donate makes me happy, too! :)\n\n[h1]What you can do![/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Collect XP from monsters and raise your level. After collecting some XP, press [C] to open your player's crafting menu so that you may craft the Mysterious Book.\n[*]Check your level and needed XP in the Overview Tab (O).\n[*]Check your stats and raise them if possible in the Stats Tab (S).\n[*]Choose and then check your current class, as well as unlock techs when possible, in the Class Tab (C).\n[*][b]Start a questline that culminates in an awesome weapon that can be upgraded twice (Class Tab).[/b]\n[*][b]Toggle Classic Mode, causing all classes to have negatives in addition to their positives (Overview Tab).[/b]\n[*][b]Choose and then check your current Affinity in the Affinity Tab (A).[/b]\n[*]Check the actual effects of your raised stats by going to the Info Tab (I).\n[*][b]Change XP to Mastery, Prestige your Class, or purchase a Mastery Shop to buy end-game items via the Mastery Tab (M).[/b]\n[*]Toggle Rally Mode, causing monsters to become more danagerous as you level.\n[*]Use the Skill Tab (K) to slightly alter your character.\n[/list]\n\n[b]In order to use Techs that require the [G] button to activate, you must configure that button in your controls configuration.[/b]\n\n[h1]What I Will Add Soon[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Add more Professions and Specializations that change up your Class. - Constant.\n[*]Balance the stats, classes, and techs depending on feedback. - Constant.\n[*]Balance and add more Skills. - Constant.\n[*]An interactive quest line with cool rewards. - Coming Last.\n[*]Incredibly dangerous Raid Bosses. - Coming Last.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Warning[/h1]\nAs of Patch 1.35, as long as you save and quit with a character, you should be able to see that character after you un-subscribe from this mod. If there are any egrigious errors, please let me know.\n[b]If you had a Tech or any items from this mod, you may get crashes if you don't visit the Tech Station before attempting to open your inventory.[/b]\n\n[h1]Compatibility[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Yes, this mod should work with Frackin Universe and Frackin Races.\n[*]If there are any problems, just tell me. I will fix them as soon as possible.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cheating[/h1]\nHere are some things you can do to test the stats, or to forcibly raise your level:\n[list]\n[*]You can spawn in the different stats. They are simply called 'stat'point, where 'stat' is replaced with the stat name.\n[*]For example, if I wanted to increase Dexterity, I could type \"spawnitem dexteritypoint (amount)\".\n[*]In addition, you can spawn XP by typing \"spawnitem experienceorb (amount)\".\n[list][*]The parentheses are not meant to be typed! They are to indicate that 'amount' is a number of your choosing.[/list]\n[*]If you would like to spawn in the Mysterious Book, type \"spawnitem RPGskillbook\"\n[*][b]Freezing Currency with a Cheat Engine can prevent the Mysterious Book from opening due to a currency used to ensure the book is only ever opened once.[/b]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Partners[/h1]\nHere's a list of many people that have either made mods that work with RPG Growth specifically, or have helped me:\n[list]\n[*]Ribs, author of Project Blade Dance, among others.
