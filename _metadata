  "description" : "[h1]The mod that adds RPG Mechanics to Starbound![/h1]\nThis mod adds the ability to raise stats and make your character stronger. Defeating monsters grants experience and raises your level. Allocate stat points, unlock techs and weapons, and choose a Profession, Affinity, and Specialization as you level up.\n\n[b]The Mysterious Book acts as the UI for raising stats, among other things.\nCraft it from your personal crafting menu, OR to access it without needing an item, download QuickBar Mini: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1088459034 [/b]\n\nIf you would like to see more information, please visit this google docs page: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t6rcD43adAM1sUD4cOROOJJXa24PZYnYy0-5a12O3Us/edit?usp=sharing\n\n[h1]Patreon and Discord[/h1]\n[b]I am currently working on a game, which means updates will be sparse.
